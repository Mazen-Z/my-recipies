<h2>Description</h2>
<p>We know it can be intimidating to grill a high quality piece of meat. What if you mess it up? 
Well, cooking a steak at home is super easy. All you really need is some salt and a meat thermometer 
to get the perfect steak. Don’t you fret though, because we’re here to walk you through how to make 
the perfect Tomahawk steak, and you are going to feel like a pro! Seriously though, with this cooking 
method you’ll feel like you are eating in a 5 star restaurant. And it’s so incredibly easy!</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT IS A TOMAHAWK STEAK? WHERE DO I PURCHASE ONE?</strong></h4>

<p>The tomahawk steak is essentially a bone-in ribeye steak. It is taken from the rib section, with the 
    large rib bone still attached. Its appearance resembles that of a tomahawk ax. Having a bone-in ribeye 
    insulates the meat while it cooks, making your meat more moist and tender. Tomahawk steaks can be found 
    in many butcher shops and are becoming more common in higher-end grocery stores. Be sure to ask at the meat 
    counter if you can special order one. They can also be purchased online.

<h4><strong>HOW DO I KNOW WHEN THE STEAKS ARE DONE?</strong></h4>
<p>In this recipe, you are instructed to cook until 130 degrees, so that after resting time it will reach 135 
    degrees Fahrenheit to be considered medium-rare. If you prefer a more well done steak, simply remove the meat 
    at 5 degrees Fahrenheit lower than your desired doneness temperature. Use a meat thermometer for best results.
</p>
<h4><strong>DO I NEED TO LET THE STEAKS REST?</strong></h4>
<p>Yes, you absolutely do not want to skip this step. The steak continues to cook during those few minutes of resting. 
    This continuation of cooking is great because it doesn’t dry out the steak, as it would by simply leaving it in the 
    oven longer. Cutting into the steak interrupts that last little period of cooking by releasing the heat inside the steak. 
    Trust us, let it rest a few minutes and your tomahawk steak will turn out perfect.

<ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons salted butter at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon parsely finely chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon rosemary finely chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>

</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat an outdoor grill to highest heat. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li><br>
    <li>Season steaks generously with salt and pepper. Use approximately 1

        and all the sides. Use a generous amount of salt as this is a thick steak.</li><br>
    <li>Sear the steak for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, letting the flames lick up the sides. 
        You'll know the steak is ready to flip when it releases easily from the grill.</li><br>
