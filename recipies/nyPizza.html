<h2>Description</h2>

<p>First of all, it's the sauce. 
    It's an emphatically tomato-ey sauce with a balanced sweetness and acidity and the barest hint of herbs and alliums. 
    I've already tackled this sauce, and the secret is to use mix of butter and olive oil, whole tomatoes, dried oregano, 
    a couple of halved onions, and a slow simmer on the stovetop.</p>
    <br>
<p>Next, it's the cheese. Unlike a Neapolitan, 
    which uses fresh mozzarella, New York-style pizza uses grated, dry mozzarella—the kind you can get 
    sliced on a meatball sub or wrapped in cryovac blocks near the milk. It's applied sparingly so that
    it melts into a loose matrix that mingles with the sauce underneath, browning ever so slightly in 
    the heat of the oven. The top of a New York-style pie should look mottled with red, white, and brown—definitely 
    not a solid expanse of white melted cheese.</p>
    <br>
<p>Thicker than a Neapolitan crust but thinner than a pan pizza, a New York crust starts with a crisp, well-browned bottom
    layer about 2 millimeters thick. It must be sturdy enough that a single slice slightly bent lengthwise down the center will 
    cantilever out straight under its own support, not requiring the eater to prop the tip with a second hand.</p>
    <br>
<p>Luckily for me, there's already a pretty fantastic recipe for New York style pizza dough out there in Peter Reinhart's American Pie,
    which if you don't already own, you should. His method is to mix together the flour, yeast, salt, sugar, olive oil, and warm water in
    the bowl of a stand mixer, knead it slowly for a couple minutes, then allow it to rest for a few minutes in a step called an autolyse.
    Autolysis allows time for flour to absorb water, and for the gluten-forming proteins to shorten themselves through enzymatic action, 
    allowing them to be more easily aligned and stretched with subsequent mixing.
<br>
    The dough is then kneaded again until enough gluten is developed to pass the windowpane test, allowed to rise overnight in the refrigerator,
     then shaped, proofed, rolled, and baked.</p>
<br>
<p>I used a food processor to create my dough. Within about 30 seconds, 
    I had a dough that easily passed the windowpane test with a smooth, 
    supple feel that you only get with many minutes of stand-mixer kneading 
    after an autolyse period. I packed away my three 12-ounce balls of dough in 
    the quart-sized deli containers I use for overnight proofs (I highly recommend
     them for this task!) and waited until the next day, where another surprise awaited me.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>22 1/2 ounces bread flour, plus more for dusting (638g; about 4 1/2 cups)</li>
    <li>0.5 ounce granulated sugar (15g; about 1 1/2 tablespoons)</li>
    <li>0.35 ounce kosher salt (10g; about 1 tablespoon)</li>
    <li>0.35 ounce instant yeast (10g; about 2 teaspoons)</li>
    <li>15 ounces lukewarm water (415g; about 1 3/4 cups) (see notes)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 batch New York style pizza sauce</li>
    <li>1 pound grated full-fat dry mozzarella cheese (454g; about 4 cups), 
        placed in freezer for at least 15 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of food processor. Pulse 3 to 
    4 times to incorporate. Add water and olive oil. Run food processor until mixture
    forms ball that rides around the bowl above the blade, about 15 seconds. Continue 
    processing 15 seconds longer.</li> <br>
<li>Transfer dough ball to lightly floured surface and knead once or twice by hand until 
    smooth ball is formed. It should pass the windowpane test. Divide dough into three 
    even portions and place each in a covered quart-sized deli container or in a zipper-lock 
    freezer bag. Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 1 day, and up to 5.</li><br>
<li>At least two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and shape into balls by 
    gathering dough towards bottom and pinching shut. Flour well and place each dough ball in 
    a separate medium mixing bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at warm room 
    temperature until roughly doubled in volume.</li><br>
<li>One hour before baking, adjust oven rack with pizza stone to middle position and preheat oven 
    to 500°F (260°C). Turn single dough ball out onto lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough 
    into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough by draping 
    over knuckles to form a 12- to 14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to pizza peel.</li>
    <br>
<li>Spread approximately 2/3 cup sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving 1/2- to 1-inch border 
    along edge. Evenly spread 1/3 of cheese over sauce. Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake until 
    cheese is melted with some browned spots and crust is golden brown and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. 
    Transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve immediately. Repeat with remaining two dough balls, 
    remaining sauce, and remaining cheese.
